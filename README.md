# Marketing Analytics Project

- Marketing Analytics is the study of data to evaluate the performance of a marketing activity.
- Marketing Analytics covers the majority of analytical processes that usually happens in the Marketing Department.

## Usual Marketing Process :

1. Business Objective & Activities
2. Selecting Channels & Defining Metrics
3. Data Engineering & Optimisation
4. Report Creation & ROI

## Projects

### 1. Campaign Journey Mapping

The cast study under this project covers the aspect of Business Objective and Activities associated with the Marketing Campaign.
For every marketing activity the main focus is on the end users or the customer, we have to draw a proper journey plan for them so they can smoothly glide through various aspects to reach the final activation point.

### 2. Metrics Selection Framework and KPI Summary Table

Here we have to build up on the Campaign Journey Mapping to figure out the metrics associated with the Marketing Campaign. The metrics are really important for us to figure out how successful our campaign is and if we need to make some changes. So for that we have to filter out the right metrics to create a KPI summary table for our Supervisors to take action from it.

### 3. Historical Analysis & Optimisation

The cast study under this project covers the aspect of Data Engineering & Optimisation associated with the Marketing Campaign.
Here we'll go through the historical data of our previous campaign and figure out the factors affecting the campaign in positive/negative direction.
